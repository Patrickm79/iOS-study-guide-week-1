/*This is a study guide for iOS Fundamentals Week 1 and covers
 
 identify, use, and understand the difference between the basic data types: `Int`, `Double`, `Bool`, `String`)
 understand how to apply mutability to variables (`let` vs. `var`)
 use conditional logic to execute various code paths
 iterate over an array using a loop to accomplish some task
 group like instructions into a function and call that function to reuse/organize code
 understand how braces `{}` are used to group code into blocks and how scope affects the lifespan of a variable
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 understand and explain version control
 configure a git identity and default editor on a computer
 create a fork on GitHub
 clone a remote Git repository
 commit changes to a Git repository and write good commit messages
 push changes to a remote Git repository
 create a pull request on GitHub
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 define custom types using class, struct, and enum
 show and explain the difference between value types vs. reference types
 create custom initializers
 understand and explain the difference between a method and a function
 understand and explain the purpose of optionals
 use an if let statement to unwrap an optional variable
 force unwrap an optional type and understand the potential dangers and benefits
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 use a guard let statement to early exit
 use the nil coalescing operator to provide a default value when an expression is nil
 use optional chaining to short circuit evaluation when a value is nil
 use class inheritance and composition
 downcast types from super classes to subclasses using `as?` or `as!`
 convert user input from `String` into a number from a `UITextField`
 walk through an app using a breakpoint and explain flow control
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Some of these steps and points will require you to provide your own input or re-create repos to have a clean slate to work from when solving again. I will try my best to get all the pertinent information but by no means is this the end all be all study guide. Use your best judgement on what you think you need more practice on, and then do that.
